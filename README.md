# final-project-mockup


The formal write up is at this link: https://jjhna.github.io/essays/UHPool.html

A lot of more work needs to be done but this should look like something like a craigslist posting but slightly a bit more complex but a lot more professional. 

This screenshot shows the homepage currently any user can hop on and add as much as they want but in the future it will be only one posting per account and the edit listing will edit that one page. A search function would also be useful. The Alert Poster will include a button that will alert the poster that someone is interesed in carpooling with them. The poster will recieve an email and on their webpage they will decide whether to give the user anymore additional information such as phone numbers and work schedule.

This screenshot shows the add listing (add contact) page where the user needs to input his full name, city, phone number, maximum occupants his vehicle can hold, email, date of posting and if the poster is looking for a driver or a passenger. I was thinking of adding a field to add their work or class schedule but at the time I'm unsure on whether or not to use this function as excel spreadsheet uploader.

Currently I'm unsure on how to approach giving out personal information, too much information is unsafe and too little is not enough. I was thinking of expanding the form into adding the work schdule showing only the start and end time of each day so that people can compare dates and time. I also need a star rating system for people to upvote or downvote any other users and a filter system to view cities from alphabetical order or by dates.
